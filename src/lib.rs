//! Cross-platform file system notification library
//!
//! The source code for this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/passcod/rsnotify).
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Simply add `notify` to your _Cargo.toml_.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! notify = "^2.5.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate notify;
//!
//! use notify::{RecommendedWatcher, Error, Watcher, RecursiveMode};
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   // Create a channel to receive the events.
//!   let (tx, rx) = channel();
//!
//!   // Automatically select the best implementation for your platform.
//!   // You can also access each implementation directly e.g. INotifyWatcher.
//!   let w: Result<RecommendedWatcher, Error> = Watcher::new(tx);
//!
//!   match w {
//!     Ok(mut watcher) => {
//!       // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
//!       // below will be monitored for changes.
//!       watcher.watch("/home/test/notify", RecursiveMode::Recursive);
//!
//!       // You'll probably want to do that in a loop. The type to match for is
//!       // notify::Event, look at src/lib.rs for details.
//!       match rx.recv() {
//!         _ => println!("Recv.")
//!       }
//!     },
//!     Err(_) => println!("Error")
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Platforms
//!
//! - Linux / Android: inotify
//! - OS X: FSEvent
//! - Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW
//! - All platforms: polling
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! ### FSEvent
//!
//! Due to the inner security model of FSEvent (see
//! [FileSystemEventSecurity](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/FileSystemEventSecurity/FileSystemEventSecurity.html)),
//! some event cannot be observed easily when trying to follow files that do not belong to you. In
//! this case, reverting to the pollwatcher can fix the issue, with a slight performance cost.
//!
//! ## Todo
//!
//! - BSD / OS X / iOS: kqueue
//! - Solaris 11: FEN
//!
//! Pull requests and bug reports happily accepted!
//!
//! ## Origins
//!
//! Inspired by Go's [fsnotify](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify), born out
//! of need for [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch), and general
//! frustration at the non-existence of C/Rust cross-platform notify libraries.
//!
//! Written by [FÃ©lix Saparelli](https://passcod.name) and awesome
//! [contributors](https://github.com/passcod/rsnotify/graphs/contributors),
//! and released in the Public Domain using the Creative Commons Zero Declaration.
