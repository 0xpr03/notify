## Origins

Inspired by Go's [fsnotify](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify), born out of need for [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch), and general frustration at the non-existence of C/Rust cross-platform notify libraries.

Written from scratch by [FÃ©lix Saparelli](https://passcod.name), and released in the Public Domain.
